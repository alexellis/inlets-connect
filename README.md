# inlets-connect - a tiny HTTP CONNECT proxy ðŸš¦

inlets-connect is a proxy that supports the HTTP CONNECT method to initiate a TCP connection over HTTP. It can be deployed as a stand-alone binary, a container, or as a side-car.

It's designed to allow access to a single, predefined address using TCP pass-through, without any decryption or MITM.

The reason inlets-connect was made was to make it easier to proxy the Kubernetes API server through inlets Pro TCP tunnels, where the TLS SAN name of the API server is fixed to `kubernetes.default.svc` for instance. This tool means that the API server can be accessed remotely from kubectl, ArgoCD and other tooling without resorting to *TLS Insecure Verify*, which is an anti-pattern.

## Usage

### Kubernetes

For usage on Kubernetes, see: [artifacts](/artifacts)

### Local

```bash
go build && ./inlets-connect --upstream 192.168.0.15:443 --port 3128

curl https://192.168.0.15 -x http://127.0.0.1:3128
```

Assuming that you want to proxy to `https://192.168.0.15`, you can start a HTTPS proxy and then use curl to access it.

This example allows the proxy running on `127.0.0.1:3128` to accept a CONNECT request and forward traffic to the `--upstream` i.e. `192.168.0.15:443`.

From within Kubernetes, the `--upstream` is likely to be `kubernetes.default.svc` and the proxy is likely to be run in a Pod.

### Usage from within a KUBECONFIG

Set the `server` as the upstream and the `proxy-url` as the endpoint for kubectl to talk to inlets-connect itself.

```yaml
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: ...
    server: https://kubernetes.svc.default:443
    proxy-url: http://127.0.0.1:3128
  name: openshift-regulated-customer
```

Then use kubectl / helm / arkade as per usual.

### Within Docker

Run the proxy with an allowed upstream of `kubernetes:443`

```bash
$ docker run -p 3128:3128 \
    -ti ghcr.io/alexellis/inlets-connect:latest -port 3128 -upstream ghost:443

2021/04/15 10:48:49 Listening on 3128, allowed upstream: ghost:443
```

Then access an endpoint local to the proxy i.e. `https://ghost` via the proxy using `curl -x http://proxy:port`

```bash
curl https://ghost -x http://127.0.0.1:3128
```
